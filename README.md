# DTGameshow

This repository builds a four player gameshow with lock-out buzzers, sound, graphics, and scoring. 

Software
---------

The software is written in pygame

Buzzer Hardware
---------------

You need some way of connecting buzzers to the software. The board directory has designs for two printed circuit boards to enable this.

You can load this code directly onto a Raspberry Pi, connect an HDMI cable, and the carrier board and have a working game.
